# PeakToBeachFix

**PeakToBeachFix** is a supporting mod for the 'Peak to Beach' mode from [PEAKapalooza](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/ExpandedReality/PEAKapalooza/). Currently, when players use 'Peak to Beach' and spawn on the top of the mountain, the hazardous fog causes damage to players' health and block their view. This mod removes the fog so players can descend the mountain and reach the beach, as the mode intended.

How to use: When this mod is installed, either launching from Thunderstore or manually placing the folder in your game's BepInEx plugins, simply follow the intruction for Peak to Beach mode from PEAKapalooza's page to proceed the game normally, the fog should be gone.

If you, or someone you know, are the author of PEAKapalooza, and are not happy with this mod, please let me know by contacting me on Discord.

## Release
### 1.0.0
